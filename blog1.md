# Post 1: First Contact with Silence

{% date "Sol 1", "2173" %}

I have left Earth behind. The last human voice I heard was Mission Control’s final farewell before the quantum signal faded into static. Now, only the hum of my ship’s life-support systems and the faint electronic whispers of the onboard AI accompany me. Silence is my new companion.

I thought I understood solitude before embarking on this mission. I was wrong. The vastness of interstellar space cannot be truly comprehended until you are suspended within it. Stars, distant and indifferent, scatter themselves across my viewport like ancient sentinels watching my journey. Each one a potential home. Each one a reminder of how far I am from my own.

The first leg of the voyage is mundane, at least on the surface. My AI handles navigation, plotting a course through the black. I keep myself occupied—routine diagnostics, exercise, logs like this. Anything to remind myself that I am still human, still bound to a world I may never see again.

For now, I push forward into the void. The silence will not break for me. I must learn to live within it.
