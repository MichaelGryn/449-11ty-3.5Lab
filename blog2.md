# Post 2: The Ghost Planet

{% date "Sol 1", "2174" %}

I have found something.

The ship’s sensors first detected it—a planet orbiting a dim red dwarf, barely visible against the black. Surface scans show vast, unnatural formations, towering structures that defy erosion and time. Not nature’s work, but someone’s. Or something’s.

I have descended into orbit, observing the ruins below. My mind reels with questions: Who built this? When? What happened to them? The AI offers theories, probabilities, but no certainty. That is my burden to uncover.

Tomorrow, I will set foot on the surface. A lone explorer walking the remains of an unknown civilization. The first human eyes to see this place, the first to hear its silence.

And yet, as I stare at the ruins below, I cannot shake a feeling—a presence at the edge of perception. A whisper in the back of my mind.

I am alone.

**Aren’t I?**
